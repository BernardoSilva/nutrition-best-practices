## Calculating caloric needs

### Step 1 - Estimate basal metabolic rate (BMR)

calories per kilogram.

Female BMR = weight in kg x 22
Male BMR = weight in kg x 24

e.g.

Benny weight 78kg

BMR = 78 x 24
BMR = 1872

Benny BMR is 1872


### Step 2 - Find Physical Activity Level (PAL)

Physical Activity Level (PAL) os the ratio of your overall daily energy expenditure to BMR.

- [ ] Mostrly inactive or sedentary(mainly sitting)             1.2
- [ ] Fairly active (includes walking and exercise 1-2 x week)  1.3
- [ ] Moderately active (exercise 2-3 x week)                   1.4
- [ ] Active (intensive exercise more than 3 x week)            1.5
- [ ] Very active (intensive exercose daily)                    1.7 


e.g.

Benny exercise 3 timesa week.
 - Benny PAL is `1.4`

 
### Step 3 - Find Daily Caloric Needs (DCN)

To calculate your DCN multiply `BMR` number (from step 1) by the `PAL` number (from step 2)

Daily Caloric Needs (DCN) = BMR x PAL

This gives you an rough idea of your daily calorie requirement to maintain your weight.


e.g.

DCN = 1872 x 1.4
DCN = 2620.8

Benny daily energy requirement is 2620.8 calories.
